Ignoring Files

Often, you’ll have a class of files that you don’t want Git to automatically add or
even show you as being untracked. These are generally automatically gener-
ated files such as log files or files produced by your build system. In such cases,
you can create a file listing patterns to match them named

The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:
• Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
• Standard glob patterns work.
• You can start patterns with a forward slash ( / ) to avoid recursivity.
• You can end patterns with a forward slash ( / ) to specify a directory.
• You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point ( ! ).
Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An aster-
isk ( * ) matches zero or more characters; [abc] matches any character inside
the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark ( ? ) matches a single char-
acter; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen ( [0-9] ) match-
es any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). You can also use two
asterisks to match nested directories; a/**/z would match a/z , a/b/z ,
a/b/c/z , and so on.
