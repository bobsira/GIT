Limiting Log Output
In addition to output-formatting options, git log takes a number of useful
limiting options – that is, options that let you show only a subset of commits.
You’ve seen one such option already – the -2 option, which show only the last
two commits. In fact, you can do -<n> , where n is any integer to show the last n
commits. In reality, you’re unlikely to use that often, because Git by default
pipes all output through a pager so you see only one page of log output at a
time.

However, the time-limiting options such as --since and --until are very
useful. For example, this command gets the list of commits made in the last two
weeks:

$ git log --since=2.weeks

This command works with lots of formats – you can specify a specific date
like "2008-01-15" , or a relative date such as "2 years 1 day 3 minutes
ago" .
