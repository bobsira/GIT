The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the git
status command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should
see something like this:

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean

This means you have a clean working directory â€“ in other words, there are no
tracked and modified files.
