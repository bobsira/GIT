Short Status
While the git status output is pretty comprehensive, it’s also quite wordy. Git
also has a short status flag so you can see your changes in a more compact way.
If you run git status -s or git status --short you get a far more simpli-
fied output from the command:

$ git status -s
M README
MM Rakefile
A lib/git.rb
M lib/simplegit.rb
?? LICENSE.txt

New files that aren’t tracked have a ?? next to them, new files that have
been added to the staging area have an A , modified files have an M and so on.
There are two columns to the output - the left-hand column indicates the status
of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the work-
ing tree. So for example in that output, the README file is modified in the work-
ing directory but not yet staged, while the lib/simplegit.rb file is modified
and staged. The Rakefile was modified, staged and then modified again, so
there are changes to it that are both staged and unstaged.
