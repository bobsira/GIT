# test line


For another example, if you stage the CONTRIBUTING.md file and then edit
it, you can use git diff to see the changes in the file that are staged and the
changes that are unstaged.

$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ echo '# test line' >> CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
modified:
CONTRIBUTING.md
Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
modified:
CONTRIBUTING.md

Now you can use git diff to see what is still unstaged:

$ git diff
diff --git a/CONTRIBUTING.md b/CONTRIBUTING.md
