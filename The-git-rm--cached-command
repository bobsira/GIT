Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working
tree but remove it from your staging area. In other words, you may want to
keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore. This is partic-
ularly useful if you forgot to add something to your .gitignore file and acci-
dentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of .a compiled files. To do this,
use the --cached option: $ git rm --cached README


You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the git rm com-
mand. That means you can do things such as:$ git rm log/\*.log

Note the backslash ( \ ) in front of the * . This is necessary because Git does its
own filename expansion in addition to your shellâ€™s filename expansion. This
command removes all files that have the .log extension in the log/ directory.
Or, you can do something like this:$ git rm \*~
This command removes all files whose names end with a ~ .
