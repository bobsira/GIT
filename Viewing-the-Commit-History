After you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with
an existing commit history, you’ll probably want to look back to see what has
happened. The most basic and powerful tool to do this is the git log com-
mand.

These examples use a very simple project called “simplegit”. To get the
project, run $ git clone https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit

When you run git log in this project, you should get output that looks
something like this:

$ git log

By default, with no arguments, git log lists the commits made in that
repository in reverse chronological order – that is, the most recent commits
show up first. As you can see, this command lists each commit with its SHA-1
checksum, the author’s name and email, the date written, and the commit mes-
sage.


A huge number and variety of options to the git log command are avail-
able to show you exactly what you’re looking for. Here, we’ll show you some of
the most popular

One of the more helpful options is -p , which shows the difference intro-
duced in each commit. You can also use -2 , which limits the output to only the
last two entries:



If you want to
see some abbreviated stats for each commit, you can use the --stat option:
$ git log --stat

As you can see, the --stat option prints below each commit entry a list of
modified files, how many files were changed, and how many lines in those files
were added and removed. It also puts a summary of the information at the end.
