This is my test file.

Staging Modified Files

Let’s change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously tracked
file called CONTRIBUTING.md and then run your git status command again,
you get something that looks like this:

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
new file:  README
Changes not staged for commit:
e "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
modified:
CONTRIBUTING.mduse "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)


The CONTRIBUTING.md file appears under a section named “Changes not
staged for commit” – which means that a file that is tracked has been modified
in the working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the git add
command

This is to test the git add command.
