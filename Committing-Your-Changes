Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your
changes. Remember that anything that is still unstaged – any files you have cre-
ated or modified that you haven’t run git add on since you edited them –
won’t go into this commit. They will stay as modified files on your disk.

The simplest way to com-
mit is to type git commit : $ git commit


Alternatively, you can type your commit message inline with the commit
command by specifying it after a -m flag, like this:

$ git commit -m "Story 182: Fix benchmarks for speed"
[master 463dc4f] Story 182: Fix benchmarks for speed
2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
