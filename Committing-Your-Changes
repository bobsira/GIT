Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your
changes. Remember that anything that is still unstaged – any files you have cre-
ated or modified that you haven’t run git add on since you edited them –
won’t go into this commit. They will stay as modified files on your disk.

The simplest way to com-
mit is to type git commit : $ git commit
