Tagging
Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in history as being im-
portant. Typically people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, and
so on).

Listing Your Tags
Listing the available tags in Git is straightforward. Just type git tag :
$ git tag
v0.1
v1.3

This command lists the tags in alphabetical order; the order in which they
appear has no real importance.
You can also search for tags with a particular pattern. The Git source repo,
for instance, contains more than 500 tags. If youâ€™re only interested in looking at
the 1.8.5 series, you can run this:
$ git tag -l "v1.8.5*"
v1.8.5
v1.8.5-rc0
v1.8.5-rc1
v1.8.5-rc2
v1.8.5-rc3
v1.8.5.1
v1.8.5.2
v1.8.5.3
v1.8.5.4
v1.8.5.5
