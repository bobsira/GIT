Removing and Renaming Remotes

You can run git remote rename to change a remote’s shortname. For in-
stance, if you want to rename pb to paul , you can do so with git remote re-
name :

$ git remote rename pb paul
$ git remote
origin
paul

It’s worth mentioning that this changes all your remote-tracking branch
names, too. What used to be referenced at pb/master is now at paul/master .
If you want to remove a remote for some reason – you’ve moved the server
or are no longer using a particular mirror, or perhaps a contributor isn’t contri-
buting anymore – you can use git remote rm :

$ git remote rm paul
$ git remote
origin
