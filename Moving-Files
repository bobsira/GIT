If you want to rename a
file in Git, you can run something like:$ git mv file_from file_to

and it works fine. In fact, if you run something like this and look at the sta-
tus, you’ll see that Git considers it a renamed file:

$ git mv README.md README
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
renamed:
README.md -> README

However, this is equivalent to running something like this:
$ mv README.md README
$ git rm README.md
$ git add README

Git figures out that it’s a rename implicitly, so it doesn’t matter if you re-
name a file that way or with the mv command. The only real difference is that
mv is one command instead of three – it’s a convenience function. More impor-
tantly, you can use any tool you like to rename a file, and address the add/rm
later, before you commit.
