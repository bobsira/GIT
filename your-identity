Your Identity
The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and
email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this informa-
tion, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, be-
cause then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that sys-
tem. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for spe-
cific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when
you’re in that project.
Many of the GUI tools will help you do this when you first run them.
